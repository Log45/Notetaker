# NoteTaker

This project is meant to eventually be a webapp, but the general idea is to take an .mp3 (or other audio format) file of a lecture or a meeting, generate a text transcript of that audio file, and create notes for that meeting or lecture.

## Status:
Currently I am messing around with an open-source Speech-to-Text model from facebook. Ignore the spaghetti code currently there. On the other side of things, the OpenAI version is already functional.


## OpenAI Iteration:

### Getting Started

- Ensure you are in the `OpenAI-Notetaker` directory
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- `OpenAI-Notetaker`/`app.py` takes the following commandline arguments:
    - `api-key`: This is a key generated by OpenAI API, this is required to run the program. (Eventually this should support using an environment variable but does not at this moment.)
    - `audio-file`: This is an audio file that you want to be transcribed and notes taken on. You must either give a relative path based on the current working directory or an absolute path.
```shell
python app.py --api-key "YOUR_API_KEY" --audio-file "path/to/audio/file"
```

## Open Source Iteration:

## Issues:
I need to figure out how to:
1. ~Split a single audio file into workable batches~
2. ~Ensure those batches have a dimension of 1~
3. Figure out model training.

## Todo:
1. Fix issues (see above)
2. Create a pipeline for taking the transcription and creating (hopefully formatted) notes
3. Turn it into a webapp (Flask)

### Datasets to Train On
- TED-LIUM (https://www.openslr.org/51)
- LibriSpeech ASR (https://openslr.org/12)
- Audio-MNIST (https://github.com/soerenab/AudioMNIST)

## Instructions
- Create a virtual environment with Python 3.8 and then enter the following commands:
```shell
brew install ffmpeg # or use apt for linux
pip3 install requirements.txt
```
