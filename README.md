# NoteTaker

This project is meant to eventually be a webapp, but the general idea is to take an .mp3 (or other audio format) file of a lecture or a meeting, generate a text transcript of that audio file, and create notes for that meeting or lecture.

## Status:
~Currently I am messing around with an open-source Speech-to-Text model from facebook. Ignore the spaghetti code currently there.~ I am planning to implement a local instance of whisper in addition to a HuggingFace Transformer model for the open source iteration. On the other side of things, the OpenAI version is already functional.


## OpenAI Iteration:

### Getting Started

- Ensure you are in the `OpenAI-Notetaker` directory
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- `OpenAI-Notetaker`/`app.py` takes the following commandline arguments:
    - `api-key`: This is a key generated by OpenAI API, this is required to run the program. (Eventually this should support using an environment variable but does not at this moment.)
    - `audio-file`: This is an audio file that you want to be transcribed and notes taken on. You must either give a relative path based on the current working directory or an absolute path.
```shell
python app.py --api-key "YOUR_API_KEY" --audio-file "path/to/audio/file"
```

## Open Source Iteration:

## Issues:
I need to figure out how to:
1. ~Split a single audio file into workable batches~
2. ~Ensure those batches have a dimension of 1~
3. Figure out model training. (None of this is needed with whisper)
4. Turns out whisper is open source: https://github.com/openai/whisper

## Todo:
1. Implement open source whisper and then use huggingface models for the notetaking portion.
2. Fix issues (see above)
3. ~Create a pipeline for taking the transcription and creating (hopefully formatted) notes~
4. Turn it into a webapp (Flask)
    - Following this tutorial to add auth: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-authentication-to-your-app-with-flask-login#step-7-setting-up-the-authorization-function
    - Need to create something that encrypts api keys in the database and decrypts them upon login
    - Need an upload page
5. Make use of environment variables for encryption secret key, database stuff, etc.
6. Need to format output files so they can be utilized by RAG later
7. Add a chat interface (implement chat functionality with GPT-3.5 and later open source transformers)
8. Implement RAG that accesses current user's transcriptions

### Datasets to Train On
- TED-LIUM (https://www.openslr.org/51)
- LibriSpeech ASR (https://openslr.org/12)
- Audio-MNIST (https://github.com/soerenab/AudioMNIST)

## Instructions
- Create a virtual environment with Python 3.8 and then enter the following commands:
```shell
brew install ffmpeg # or use apt for linux
pip3 install requirements.txt
```
